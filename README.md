This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Check out the live coronavirus app at www.cvirustracker.tech.

The API used in this project stopped displaying the daily values. The whole project still works absolutely fine.

## COVID-19 Tracker Web App Project Description

COVID-19 Tracker app is a front-end website application.

- The app shows real-time data of:

  1. number of people infected by coronavirus.
  2. number of people killed by coronavirus.
  3. number of people recovered from coronavirus.

- The app provides users with the options of selecting global data or data from different countries.
- The app maps out the global data with a line chart.
  - The line chart shows both infected and death cases.
- The app maps out the data from different countries with a bar chart.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
